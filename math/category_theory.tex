  A \textbf{category} $\mathscr{C}$ contains a collection of

  \textit{morphisms} (denoted as $\mathscr{C}_1$) where every morphism has

  each arrow to its \textit{source} and \textit{target} objects respectively
  into the collection of objects.\\

  For any two arrows $f,g$ where the $target(f)=source(g)$, the
  \textit{composition} of $f$ and $g$ are written as $g\circ
  f:source(f)\rightarrow target(g)\in\mathscr{C}_1$. Composition is
  associative, $(h\circ g)\circ f=h\circ (g\circ f)$ when either side is
  defined.\\

  $id_A:A\rightarrow A$ and for any $f:A\rightarrow B$, $f\circ id_A=id_B\circ
  f=f$.\\

  A category is \textit{small} if its objects and arrows constitute sets;
  otherwise it is \textit{large}.

\longnewglossaryentry{categoryexamples}
{
  name={Examples of Categories:}
} {
  \begin{itemize}[align=left]
    \item[\textbf{Set}]
      is the category whose objects are sets and arrows are functions
      between sets. Composition is function composition and the identity
      arrow is the identity function $id_S$ for a set $S$.

    \item[\textbf{Fin}]
      is the category whose objects are finite sets and arrows are all the
      functions between finite sets.

    \item[\textbf{Pfn}]
      is the category whose objects are sets but all arrows are all partial
      functions. If $f:S\rightarrow T, g:T\rightarrow V$ are partial
      functions with $f$ defined on $S_0\subseteq S$ and $g$ defined on
      $T_0\subseteq T$, then the composite $g\circ f:S\rightarrow V$ is the
      partial function from $S$ to $V$ defined on the subset $\{x\in
      S_0|f(x)\in T_0\}$ of $S$ by the requirement $(g\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))$.

    \item[\textbf{Rel}]
      is the category whose objects are sets and arrows are relations
      relations between sets. The composite $\beta\circ\alpha$ of relations
      $\alpha$ from sets $S$ to $T$ and $\beta$ from $T$ to $U$ is a
      relation from $S$ to $U$ defined as follows:
      \begin{center}
        If $x\in S$ and $z\in U$, $(x,z)\in\beta\circ\alpha$ if and only if
        there is an element $y\in T$ for which $(x,y)\in\alpha$ and
        $(y,z)\in\beta$.
      \end{center}
      The identity arrow for a set $S$ is the \textit{diagonal relation}
      $\Delta_S=\{(x,x)|x\in S\}$

    \item [\textbf{Poset}]
      is the category whose objects are elements of a poset $P$ and arrows
      are the partially ordered relation between those elements. The
      reflexive and transitive properties provides the identity and
      composition of arrows.
      \begin{note}
        Every hom-set in this category has at most ONE element.
        Equivalently, any category where every hom-set has at most one element
        is a poset.
      \end{note}

    \item [\textbf{Monoid}]
      is the category whose only object is the Monoid itself and arrows are
      the elements of the monoid. The identity arrow is the identity element
      and composition being the monoid binary operation.
      \begin{note}
        Any category with one object is a monoid.
      \end{note}

    \item [\textbf{Group}]
      is the category whose only object is the Group itself and arrows are
      elements of the group, same as the category determined by a Monoid.
      \begin{note}
        All arrows in this category are isomorphisms.
      \end{note}

    \item [\textbf{Grf}]
      is the category whose objects are graphs and arrows are graph
      homomorphisms. Identity arrow being the identity homormophism and
      composition being composition of homomorphisms.

    \item [\textbf{Posets and Monotone Functions}]
      is the category whose objects are posets and arrows are monotone
      functions between posets.

    \item [\textbf{Sem}]
      is the category whose objects are semigroups and arrows are semigroup
      homomorphisms.
      \begin{note}
        This can be extended to monoids, denoted as \textbf{Mon}.
      \end{note}

    \item[\textbf{$\omega$-CPOs and Scott-continuous Functions}]
      is the category whose objects are $\omega$-CPOs and arrows are
      Scott-continuous functions.
      \begin{note}
        A category is also formed with \textit{strict} $\omega$-CPOs and
        \textit{strict} Scott-continous functions.
      \end{note}

    \item[\textbf{Path Category}]
      is the free category $F(\mathscr{G})$ generated by a graph
      $\mathscr{G}$ whose objects are the nodes of $\mathscr{G}$ and arrows
      are paths in $\mathscr{G}$. For each node/object $A$, the identity
      arrow is the empty path from $A$ to $A$. Composition is defined by
      $(f_1,\dots,f_k)\circ(f_{k+1},\dots,f_n)=(f_1,\dots,f_n)$

\longnewglossaryentry{subcategory}

  A \textbf{subcategory} $\mathscr{D}$ of a category
  $\mathscr{C}$ is a category for which:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item All objects and arrows in $\mathscr{D}$ are objects and arrows in
      $\mathscr{C}$ (ie: $\mathscr{D}_0\subseteq\mathscr{C}_0$ and
      $\mathscr{D}_1\subseteq\mathscr{C}_1$).

    \item The source and target of an arrow in $\mathscr{D}$ are the same as
      its souce and target in $\mathscr{C}$ (ie: source and target maps in
      $\mathscr{D}$ are restrictions of those in $\mathscr{C}$). Thus,
      $\forall A,B\in\mathscr{C}_0$,
      $\Hom_{\mathscr{D}}(A,B)\subseteq\Hom_{\mathscr{C}}(A,B)$.

    \item If $A$ is an object in $\mathscr{C}$, its identity arrow $id_A$ in
      $\mathscr{C}$ is in $\mathscr{D}$.

    \item If $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:B\rightarrow C$ in $\mathscr{D}$,
      then the composite $g\circ f\in\mathscr{C}_1$ is also the composite in
      $\mathscr{D}$.

{
  name=Product of Categories,

    D\in\mathscr{D}_0$ and arrows are $(f,g):(C,D)\rightarrow (C',D')$ where

    The identity arrow of $(C,D)$ is $(id_C,id_D)$ and composition of arrows is
  defined component wise.}

\longnewglossaryentry{categoricaldual}
{
  name=Categorical Dual,
  text=categorical dual,

} {
  Given any category $\mathscr{C}$, $\mathscr{C}^{op}$ is the
  \textbf{dual category} of $\mathscr{C}$ where all the arrows are reversed.
  $\mathscr{C}^{op}$ is defined as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The objects and arrows of $\mathscr{C}^{op}$ are the objects and
      arrows of $\mathscr{C}$.

    \item If $f:A\rightarrow B$ in $\mathscr{C}$, then $f:B\rightarrow A$ in
      $\mathscr{C}^{op}$.

    \item If $h=g\circ f$ in $\mathscr{C}$, then $h=f\circ g$ in
      $\mathscr{C}^{op}$.
  \end{itemize}
  Since identity arrows have the same source and target objects, identity
  arrows in $\mathscr{C}$ are the same as in $\mathscr{C}^{op}$ and thus
  $\mathscr{C}^{op}$ is also a category.

  If $\mathscr{C}$ is a category, for any object $A\in\mathscr{C}_0$, the

      $\mathscr{C}$ for some $C\in\mathscr{C}_0$.

      $f':C'\rightarrow A$ is an arrow $h:C\rightarrow C'$ such that
      $f=f'\circ h$.

    \item The composite of $h:f\circ f'$ and $h':f'\circ f''$ is $h'\circ
      h$.

  \begin{note}
    Since the same $h$ can satisfy both $f=f'\circ h$ and $g=g'\circ h$
    where $f\neq g$ or $f'\neq g'$, $h:f\rightarrow f'$ and $h:g\rightarrow
    g'$ are regarded as different arrows in $\mathscr{C}/A$.
